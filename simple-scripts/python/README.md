# Python - Hello World

## Code

To print "Hello World" with python, you don't need to import stuff nor declare your main function and anything else.

You can just run a:

    print("Hello World!")

## Running

Save a file named like `main.py`, put the line above in it and run

    python3 main.py

You can also start an interactive session just by running

    python3

And then write your code at the same time you're running it.
